SambaNova AI Starter Kits
====================

# Overview
SambaNova AI Starter Kits are a collection of open-source examples and guides to facilitate the deployment of AI-driven use cases in the enterprise.

To run these examples, you need access to a SambaStudio environment with your models deployed to endpoints. Most code examples are written in Python, though the concepts can be applied in any language.

If you have any issues with the examples or to provide feedback, [create an issue](https://github.com/sambanova/ai-starter-kit/issues/new/choose) in GitHub.

# Get started with SambaNova AI starter kit

## Setting your model

### (Option 1) Use Sambaverse models
Begin by creating a [Sambaverse](sambaverse.sambanova.net) account, then [get your API key](https://docs.sambanova.ai/sambaverse/latest/use-sambaverse.html#_your_api_key) from the username button. Use the available models.

### (Option 2) Deploy your model in SambaStudio
Begin by deploying your LLM of choice (e.g. Llama 2 13B chat, etc) to an endpoint for inference in SambaStudio. Use either the GUI or CLI, as described in the [SambaStudio endpoint documentation](https://docs.sambanova.ai/sambastudio/latest/endpoints.html).

## Integrate your model in the starter kit
Integrate your LLM deployed on SambaStudio with this AI starter kit in two simple steps:

### 1. Clone this repo
```
  git clone https://github.com/sambanova/ai-starter-kit.git
```
### 2. Update API information for the SambaNova LLM
 These are represented as configurable variables in the environment variables file in `sn-ai-starter-kit/.env`. 

#### SambaStudio deployed model

For example, enter an endpoint with the URL
"https://api-stage.sambanova.net/api/predict/nlp/12345678-9abc-def0-1234-56789abcdef0/456789ab-cdef-0123-4567-89abcdef0123"
in the env file (with no spaces) as:
```
BASE_URL="https://api-stage.sambanova.net"
PROJECT_ID="12345678-9abc-def0-1234-56789abcdef0"
ENDPOINT_ID="456789ab-cdef-0123-4567-89abcdef0123"
API_KEY="89abcdef-0123-4567-89ab-cdef01234567"
```

#### Sambaverse model

Enter a Sambaverse API key, for example
"456789ab-cdef-0123-4567-89abcdef0123",
in the env file (with no spaces) as:

```
SAMBAVERSE_API_KEY="456789ab-cdef-0123-4567-89abcdef0123"
```

### 3. Update API information for SambaNova Embeddings model (optional).

Update API information for the SambaNova embedding endpoint.  These are represented as configurable variables in the environment variables file in the root repo directory **```sn-ai-starter-kit/.env```**. For example, an endpoint with the URL
"https://api-stage.sambanova.net/api/predict/nlp/12345678-9abc-def0-1234-56789abcdef0/456789ab-cdef-0123-4567-89abcdef0123"
would be entered in the env file (with no spaces) as:
```
EMBED_BASE_URL="https://api-stage.sambanova.net"
EMBED_PROJECT_ID="12345678-9abc-def0-1234-56789abcdef0"
EMBED_ENDPOINT_ID="456789ab-cdef-0123-4567-89abcdef0123"
EMBED_API_KEY="89abcdef-0123-4567-89ab-cdef01234567"
```

### 4. Run the desired starter kit

Go to the `README.md` of the starter kit you want to use and follow the instructions. See [Available AI Starter Kits](#available-ai-starter-kits).

## Use Sambanova's LLMs and **Langchain** wrappers 

### LLM Wrappers

Set your environment as shown in [integrate your model](#integrate-your-model-in-the-starter-kit).

#### Using Sambaverse LLMs 

1. Import the **samabanova_endpoint** langchain wrapper in your project and define your **SambaverseEndpoint** LLM:

``` python
from utils.sambanova_endpoint import SambaverseEndpoint

load_dotenv('.env')

llm = SambaverseEndpoint(
    sambaverse_model_name="Meta/llama-2-7b-chat-hf",
    model_kwargs={
      "do_sample": False, 
      "temperature": 0.0,
      "max_tokens_to_generate": 512,
      "select_expert": "llama-2-7b-chat-hf"
      },
)
```
2. Use the model

```python
llm.invoke("your prompt")
```

#### Using Sambastudio LLMs
1. Import the **samabanova_endpoint** langchain wrapper in your project and define your **SambaNovaEndpoint** LLM:

``` python
from utils.sambanova_endpoint import SambaNovaEndpoint

load_dotenv('.env')

llm = SambaNovaEndpoint(
    model_kwargs={
      "do_sample": False, 
      "max_tokens_to_generate": 512,
      "temperature": 0.0
      },
)
```

2. Use the model

```python
llm.invoke("your prompt")
```

See [utils/usage.ipynb](./utils/usage.ipynb) for an example. 

### Embedding Wrapper

#### Use SambaStudio Embedding models

1. Set the embeddding model endpoint variables in your env file.
For example, enter an embeding endpoint with the URL
"https://api-stage.sambanova.net/api/predict/nlp/12345678-9abc-def0-1234-56789abcdef0/456789ab-cdef-0123-4567-89abcdef0123"
in the `env` file (with no spaces) as:

```yaml
EMBED_BASE_URL="https://api-stage.sambanova.net"
EMBED_PROJECT_ID="12345678-9abc-def0-1234-56789abcdef0"
EMBED_ENDPOINT_ID="456789ab-cdef-0123-4567-89abcdef0123"
EMBED_API_KEY="89abcdef-0123-4567-89ab-cdef01234567"
```

2. Import the **samabanova_endpoint** langchain wrapper in your project and define your **SambaNovaEmbeddingModel** embedding:

``` python
from utils.sambanova_endpoint import SambaNovaEndpoint

load_dotenv('.env')

embedding = SambaNovaEmbeddingModel()
```

3. Use your embedding model in your langchain pipeline

See [utils/usage.ipynb](./utils/usage.ipynb) for an example.
