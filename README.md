# Get started with SambaNova AI starter kit

## Setting your model

### Use Sambaverse models (Option 1)

Sambaverse allows you to interact with multiple open-source models. You can view the list of available models and interact with them in the [playground](https://sambaverse.sambanova.ai/playground).

Please note that Sambaverse's free offering is performance-limited. Companies that are ready to evaluate the production tokens-per-second performance, volume throughput, and 10x lower total cost of ownership (TCO) of SambaNova should [contact us](https://sambaverse.sambanova.ai/contact-us) for a non-limited evaluation instance.

Begin by creating a [Sambaverse](https://sambaverse.sambanova.net) account, then [get your API key](https://docs.sambanova.ai/sambaverse/latest/use-sambaverse.html#_your_api_key) from the username button. Use the available models.

### Deploy your model in SambaStudio (Option 2)

Begin by deploying your LLM of choice (e.g. Llama 2 13B chat, etc) to an endpoint for inference in SambaStudio. Use either the GUI or CLI, as described in the [SambaStudio endpoint documentation](https://docs.sambanova.ai/sambastudio/latest/endpoints.html).

## Integrate your model in the starter kit

Integrate your LLM deployed on SambaStudio with this AI starter kit in two simple steps:

### 1. Clone this repo

```
  git clone https://github.com/sambanova/ai-starter-kit.git
```

### 2. Update API information for the SambaNova LLM

These are represented as configurable variables in the environment variables file in `sn-ai-starter-kit/.env`.

#### SambaStudio deployed model

For example, enter an endpoint with the URL
"https://api-stage.sambanova.net/api/predict/nlp/12345678-9abc-def0-1234-56789abcdef0/456789ab-cdef-0123-4567-89abcdef0123"
in the env file (with no spaces) as:

```
SAMBASTUDIO_BASE_URL="https://api-stage.sambanova.net"
SAMBASTUDIO_BASE_URI="api/predict/nlp"
SAMBASTUDIO_PROJECT_ID="12345678-9abc-def0-1234-56789abcdef0"
SAMBASTUDIO_ENDPOINT_ID="456789ab-cdef-0123-4567-89abcdef0123"
SAMBASTUDIO_API_KEY="89abcdef-0123-4567-89ab-cdef01234567"
```

#### FastAPI model

- Enter the FastCoE url and the FastCoE API key (with no spaces), as in the following example:

```
    FAST_COE_URL = "https://fastapi.snova.ai/api/v1/chat/completion"
    FAST_COE_API_KEY = "456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123"
```

#### Sambaverse model

Enter a Sambaverse API key, for example
"456789ab-cdef-0123-4567-89abcdef0123",
in the env file (with no spaces) as:

```
SAMBAVERSE_API_KEY="456789ab-cdef-0123-4567-89abcdef0123"
```

### 3. Update API information for SambaNova Embeddings model (optional).

You can use SambaStudio E5 embedding model endpoint instead of using default in cpu HugginFace embeddings to increase inference speed, follow [this guide](https://docs.sambanova.ai/sambastudio/latest/e5-large.html#_deploy_an_e5_large_v2_endpoint) to deploy your SambaStudio embedding model

> _be sure to set batch size model parameter to 32_

Update API information for the SambaNova embedding endpoint. These are represented as configurable variables in the environment variables file in the root repo directory **`sn-ai-starter-kit/.env`**. For example, an endpoint with the URL
"https://api-stage.sambanova.net/api/predict/nlp/12345678-9abc-def0-1234-56789abcdef0/456789ab-cdef-0123-4567-89abcdef0123"
would be entered in the env file (with no spaces) as:

```
SAMBASTUDIO_EMBEDDINGS_BASE_URL="https://api-stage.sambanova.net"
SAMBASTUDIO_EMBEDDINGS_BASE_URI="api/predict/nlp"
SAMBASTUDIO_EMBEDDINGS_PROJECT_ID="12345678-9abc-def0-1234-56789abcdef0"
SAMBASTUDIO_EMBEDDINGS_ENDPOINT_ID="456789ab-cdef-0123-4567-89abcdef0123"
SAMBASTUDIO_EMBEDDINGS_API_KEY="89abcdef-0123-4567-89ab-cdef01234567"
```

### 4. Run the desired starter kit

Go to the `README.md` of the starter kit you want to use and follow the instructions. See [Available AI Starter Kits](#available-ai-starter-kits).

## Use Sambanova's LLMs and **Langchain** wrappers

### LLM Wrappers

Set your environment as shown in [integrate your model](#integrate-your-model-in-the-starter-kit).

#### Using Sambaverse LLMs

1. Import the **samabanova_endpoint** langchain wrapper in your project and define your **Sambaverse** LLM:

```python
from langchain_community.llms.sambanova import Sambaverse

load_dotenv('.env')

llm = Sambaverse(
    sambaverse_model_name="Meta/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct",
    model_kwargs={
      "do_sample": False,
      "temperature": 0.0,
      "max_tokens_to_generate": 512,
      "select_expert": "Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct",
      "process_prompt": "False"
      },
)
```

2. Use the model

```python
llm.invoke("your prompt")
```

#### Using Sambastudio LLMs

1. Import the **samabanova_endpoint** langchain wrapper in your project and define your **SambaStudio* LLM:

- If using a CoE endpont

```python
from langchain_community.llms.sambanova import SambaStudio

load_dotenv('.env')

llm = SambaNovaEndpoint(
    model_kwargs={
      "do_sample": False,
      "max_tokens_to_generate": 512,
      "temperature": 0.0,
      "select_expert": "Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct",
      "process_prompt": "False"
      },
)
```

- If using a single model endpont

```python
from langchain_community.llms.sambanova import SambaStudio

load_dotenv('.env')

llm = SambaNovaEndpoint(
    model_kwargs={
      "do_sample": False,
      "max_tokens_to_generate": 512,
      "temperature": 0.0,
      "process_prompt": "False"
      },
)
```

2. Use the model

```python
llm.invoke("your prompt")
```

See [utils/usage.ipynb](./utils/usage.ipynb) for an example.

### Embedding Wrapper

1. Import the **sambastudio_endpoint** langchain wrapper in your project and define your **SambaStudioEmbeddings** embedding:

- If using a CoE endpont

```python
from langchain_community.embeddings import SambaStudioEmbeddings

load_dotenv('.env')

embedding = SambaStudioEmbeddings(
              batch_size=1,
              model_kwargs = {
                  "select_expert":e5-mistral-7b-instruct
                  }
              )
```

- If using a single embedding model endpont

```python
from langchain_community.embeddings import SambaStudioEmbeddings

load_dotenv('.env')

embedding = SambaStudioEmbeddings(batch_size=32)
```

> Note that using different embedding models (cpu or sambastudio) may change the results, and change the way they are set and their parameters

2. Use your embedding model in your langchain pipeline

See [utils/usage.ipynb](./utils/usage.ipynb) for an example.

## Setting Up Your Environment

There are two approaches to setting up your environment for the AI Starter Kits:

1. **Individual Kit Setup (Traditional Method)**
2. **Base Environment Setup (WIP)**

### 1. Individual Kit Setup

Each starter kit has its own `README.md` and `requirements.txt` file. You can set up a separate virtual environment for each kit by following the instructions in their respective directories. This method is suitable if you're only interested in running a single kit or prefer isolated environments for each project.

To use this method:
1. Navigate to the specific kit's directory
2. Create a virtual environment
3. Install the requirements
4. Follow the kit-specific instructions

### 2. Base Environment Setup 

For users who plan to work with multiple kits or prefer a unified development environment, we recommend setting up a base environment. This approach uses a Makefile to automate the setup of a consistent Python environment that works across all kits.

Benefits of the base environment approach:
- Consistent Python version across all kits
- Centralized dependency management
- Simplified setup process
- Easier switching between different kits

#### Prerequisites

- **pyenv**: The Makefile will attempt to install pyenv if it's not already installed.
- **Docker**: (Optional) If you want to use the Docker-based setup, ensure Docker is installed on your system.

#### What the Base Setup Does

1. Installs pyenv and Poetry if they are not already installed.
2. Sets up a Python virtual environment using a specified Python version (default is 3.11.3).
3. Installs all necessary dependencies for the base environment.
4. Sets up the parsing service required by some kits.
5. Installs system dependencies like Tesseract OCR and Poppler.
6. Provides Docker-based setup options for consistent environments across different systems.



#### Setting Up the Base Environment


1. **Install and Set Up the Base Environment:**

```bash
make all
```
This command will set up the base ai-starter-kit environment, including installing all necessary tools and dependencies.

2. **Activate the Base Environment:**

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. **Navigate to Your Chosen Starter Kit:**
```bash
cd path/to/starter_kit
```
Within the starter kit there will be instructions on how to start the kit. You can skip the virtual environment creation 
part in the kits README.md as we've done it here.



### Parsing Service Management
For certain kits, we utilise a standard parsing service. By Default it's started automatically with the base environment. To work with this service in isolation, following the steps in this section.

- **Start Parsing Service:**
```bash
make start-parsing-service
```

- **Stop Parsing Service:**
```bash
make stop-parsing-service
```

- **Check Parsing Service Status:**
```bash
make parsing-status
```

- **View Parsing Service Logs:**
```bash
make parsing-log
```

### Docker-based Setup

To use the Docker-based setup:

1. Ensure Docker is installed on your system.
2. Build the Docker image:

```bash
make docker-build
```

3. Run a specific kit in the Docker container:
```bash
make docker-run-kit KIT=<kit_name>
```
Replace `<kit_name>` with the name of the starter kit you want to run (e.g., `function_calling`).

4. To open a shell in the Docker container:
```bash
make docker-shell
```

### Cleanup

To clean up all virtual environments created by the makefile and stop parsing services run the following command:
```bash
make clean
```
This command removes all virtual environments created with the makefile, stops the parsing service, and cleans up any temporary files.


## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while setting up or running the AI Starter Kit, here are some common problems and their solutions:


### Python version issues

If you're having problems with Python versions:

1. Ensure you have pyenv installed: `make ensure-pyenv`
2. Install the required Python versions: `make install-python-versions`
3. If issues persist, check your system's Python installation and PATH settings.

### Dependency conflicts

If you're experiencing dependency conflicts:

1. Try cleaning your environment: `make clean`
2. Update the lock file: `poetry lock --no-update`
3. Reinstall dependencies: `make install`

### pikepdf installation issues

If you encounter an error while installing `pikepdf`, such as:

```
ERROR: Failed building wheel for pikepdf
Failed to build pikepdf
```

This is likely due to missing `qpdf` dependency. The Makefile should automatically install `qpdf` for you, but if you're still encountering issues:

1. Ensure you have proper permissions to install system packages.
2. If you're on macOS, you can manually install `qpdf` using Homebrew:
   ```bash
   brew install qpdf
   ```
3. On Linux, you can install it using your package manager, e.g., on Ubuntu:
   ```
   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y qpdf
   ```
4. After installing `qpdf`, try running `make install` again.

If you continue to face issues, please ensure your system meets all the requirements for building `pikepdf` and consider checking the [pikepdf documentation](https://pikepdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) for more detailed installation instructions.


### Parsing service issues

If the parsing service isn't starting or is behaving unexpectedly:

1. Check its status: `make parsing-status`
2. View its logs: `make parsing-log`
3. Try stopping and restarting it: `make stop-parsing-service` followed by `make start-parsing-service`

### System Dependencies Issues

If you encounter issues related to Tesseract OCR or Poppler:

1. Ensure the Makefile has successfully installed these dependencies.
2. On macOS, you can manually install them using Homebrew:
 ```bash
   brew install tesseract poppler
   ```
3. On Linux (Ubuntu/Debian), you can install them manually:
 ```bash
   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y tesseract-ocr poppler-utils
   ```
4. On Windows, you may need to install these dependencies manually and ensure they are in your system PATH.

### Docker-related Issues

If you're using the Docker-based setup and encounter issues:

1. Ensure Docker is properly installed and running on your system.
2. Try rebuilding the Docker image: `make docker-build`
3. Check Docker logs for any error messages.
4. Ensure your firewall or antivirus is not blocking Docker operations.

### General troubleshooting steps

1. Ensure all prerequisites (Python, pyenv, Poetry) are correctly installed.
2. Try cleaning and rebuilding the environment: `make clean all`
3. Check for any error messages in the console output and address them specifically.
4. Ensure your `.env` file is correctly set up in the ai-starter-kit root with all necessary environment variables.

If you continue to experience issues, please [open an issue](https://github.com/sambanova/ai-starter-kit/issues/new) with details about your environment, the full error message, and steps to reproduce the problem.

### Important Notes for Users

- Ensure you have sufficient permissions to install software on your system.
- The setup process may take several minutes, especially when installing Python versions or large dependencies.
- If you encounter any issues during setup, check the error messages and ensure your system meets all prerequisites.
- Always activate the base environment before navigating to and running a specific starter kit.
- Some kits may require additional setup steps. Always refer to the specific README of the kit you're using.
