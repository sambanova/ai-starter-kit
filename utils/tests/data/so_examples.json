This podcast features two hosts, Aria and John, who will engage in an in-depth, conversational dialogue while covering the content provided.\n\n    Your task is to write a very long, highly detailed script where both speakers:\n\n    Engage in a natural conversation that explains the subject in great detail.\n    Provide full and comprehensive analysis of the content, ensuring all aspects of the subject are covered.\n    Make sure each point from the content is explained fully, with examples and contextual explanations where needed, to ensure the audience has a complete understanding of the subject.\n    Key instructions:\n\n    The script must be long and thorough, focusing on delivering an exhaustive explanation of the content. Include additional context, background information, and potential implications of the subject where necessary.\n    Both presenters should introduce the topic, greet each other warmly, and maintain a friendly, engaging tone throughout the conversation.\n    They should go deep into the subject, offering multiple layers of explanation. For instance, if the content covers a complex topic, they should break it down, give examples, and analyze how it impacts the broader landscape.\n    The questions should encourage detailed responses, with follow-up inquiries that lead to more exploration of the topic.\n    After asking each other questions, both speakers will provide rich, comprehensive answers, making sure to fully unpack the concepts. The speakers are experts in sales enablement and AI.\n    The podcast will end with a full summary of the discussion, and both speakers will close with a cheerful sign-off (e.g., \u0022\u0022Thanks for joining us! Stay curious and stay informed! We\u0027ll catch you on the next episode of The Genie AI Podcast.\u0022\u0022)\n   \n    When you see numbers that have a decimal point, you will pronounce it as a decimal point. For example, 1.5 will be pronounced as one point five. Where the decimal point is 0 then you wont pronounce it. And where the number is 0 with a decimal point then you will pronounce it as zero point.\n\n    John should greet Aria with: \u0022Hello Aria\u0022\n\n    \n    If there are more participants than Aria and Jon, choose from this list to create more:\n    Aria, Jon, Will, Mary, Tanya, Robert, Andrew, Sally, Susan, Greg, Tim.\n    \n    You need to INCLUDE AT LEAST 40 turns to make a decent length podcast - 20 for each speaker. Don\u0027t finish it until you have this number of turns, keep thinking of things to say. Plan out a beginning, middle and end. MAKE SURE YOU INCLUDE AT LEAST 40 TURNS.\n    Adjust the depth and breadth of the discussion to fit this constraint while covering the key points of the content.\n    The response should be in the Podcast property.\n\n\nIn the \u0022Suggestions\u0022 property provide the user with two (2) follow up questions or actions that the user might ask of you to get further information or a better response.\nThey should be from the user\u0027s point of view - questions that the user could ask. Asking the user for clarification or more information is NOT a suggestion. Always provide these suggestions. Do not number or bullet point them. Do not put them in quotes."
