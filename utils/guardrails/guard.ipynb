      "There are several types of medications that can help reduce allergy symptoms. Here are some common ones:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Antihistamines: These medications help block the effects of histamine, a chemical that the immune system releases in response to an allergen. Antihistamines can help relieve symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose, itchy eyes, and hives. Some common antihistamines include diphenhydramine (Benadryl), loratadine (Claritin), cetirizine (Zyrtec), and fexofenadine (Allegra).\n",
      "2. Decongestants: These medications help reduce swelling and congestion in the nasal passages and sinuses. Decongestants can help relieve symptoms such as stuffy nose, sinus pressure, and headache. Some common decongestants include pseudoephedrine (Sudafed, Claritin-D, Allegra-D, Zyrtec-D) and phenylephrine (Sudafed PE, Neo-Synephrine, Dristan, Afrin).\n",
      "3. Leukotriene modifiers: These medications help block the effects of leukotrienes, chemicals that the immune system releases in response to an allergen. Leukotriene modifiers can help relieve symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose, itchy eyes, and hives. Some common leukotriene modifiers include montelukast (Singulair) and zafirlukast (Accolate).\n",
      "4. Corticosteroids: These medications are powerful anti-inflammatory agents that can help reduce swelling and inflammation in the nasal passages, sinuses, and other areas of the body affected by allergies. Corticosteroids can help relieve symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose, itchy eyes, and hives. Some common corticosteroids used to treat allergies include beclomethasone (Qvar, Beclovent), budesonide (Rhinocort, Pulmicort), fluticasone (Flonase, Fluticasone Propionate), mometasone (Nasonex), and triamcinolone (Nasacort, Azmacort).\n",
      "\n",
      "It's important to note that different medications may work better for different people, and some medications may have more side effects than others. Therefore, it's important to talk to your healthcare provider about which medication is right for you, and to follow their instructions carefully.\n",
