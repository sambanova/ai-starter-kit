    Here is the code:\n {code}.
    Here is the exception message:\n {error}.
    Do not return examples using  exec, just the updated code.  You should always place the code in the following format: ```python CODE\n```.  Ensure that all necessary imports are made. You should not return the same code that was passed to you.  You should attempt to fix it based on the exception you encounter.  You should never try to send a GET request or use beautiful soup.\n  <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
