PLOT_INSTRUCTIONS = """
    Please ensure that any figures you generate display dates in chronological and ascending order,
    i.e. from the earliest year (the lowest value) to the most recent year (the highest value).
    Dates should be displayed using only the year (with 4 digits) and month (with 2 digits),
    separated by a dash symbol (e.g. 2024/09).
    Clearly append the units of measurement to the labels of both x and y axes of each figure.
    Please plot a figure only if you have more than two data points.
