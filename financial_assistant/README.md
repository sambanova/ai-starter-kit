# Before you begin

You have to set up your environment before you can run or customize the starter kit.

## Clone this repository

Clone the starter kit repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sambanova/ai-starter-kit.git
```

## Set up the models, environment variables and config file

### Set up the generative model

The next step is to set up your environment variables to use one of the inference models available from SambaNova. You can obtain a free API key through SambaCloud.

Follow the instructions [here](../README.md#getting-a-sambanova-api-key-and-setting-your-generative-models) to set up your environment variables.

Then, in the [config file](./config.yaml), set the `model` config depending on the model you want to use.

## Windows requirements

- If you are using Windows, make sure your system has Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable installed. You can install it from [Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) and make sure to check all boxes regarding C++ section. (Compatible versions: 2015, 2017, 2019 or 2022)

# Deploy the starter kit GUI

We recommend that you run the starter kit in a virtual environment or use a container. We also require the use of Python versions `>= 3.11 and < 3.12`."

## Use a virtual environment

If you want to use a Python virtual environment:

1. Install and update `pip`.

    ```bash
    cd ai-starter-kit/financial_assistant
    python3 -m venv financial_assistant_venv
    source financial_assistant_venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Run the following command:

    ```bash
        streamlit run streamlit/app.py --browser.gatherUsageStats false 
    ```

## Further settings

For the `SEC-EDGAR` functionalities, company name and email are used to form a user-agent of the form:
USER_AGENT: ```<Company Name> <Email Address>```.

```
# Your organization
SEC_API_ORGANIZATION="<your organization>"

# Your email address
SEC_API_EMAIL="<user@email_provider.com>"
```

## Exit the app
Once you have finished using the app, you can exit the app by clicking on `Exit` at the top of the sidebar.
This will clear the cache.
Otherwise, the cache will be automatically cleared after a predefined time period.

## Third-party tools and data sources

All the packages/tools are listed in the `requirements.txt` file in the project directory.
