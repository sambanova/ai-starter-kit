# Saved Artifacts

This directory stores YAML files saved from the SambaWiz application:

- **Bundle YAMLs**: Files saved from SambaWiz Section 4 (format: `<bundle-name>.yaml`)
- **Bundle Deployment YAMLs**: Files saved from Bundle Deployment Section 2 (format: `<bundle-deployment-name>.yaml`)

## Features

- Files are automatically saved when you click the "SAVE" button
- If a file with the same name already exists, you'll be prompted to either overwrite it or cancel
- All saved files are stored with their original names for easy identification
