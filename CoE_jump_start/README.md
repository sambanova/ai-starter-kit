# Using Composition of Experts (CoE) Models with Langchain

This repository provides a Python script and a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrate how to call SambaNova CoE models using the Langchain framework. The script offers different approaches for calling CoE models, including using SambaVerse, SambaStudio with a named expert, and SambaStudio with routing.

## Features

- Call CoE models using SambaVerse, providing the expert name and API key.
- Call CoE models using SambaStudio with a named expert.
- Call CoE models using SambaStudio with routing, automatically determining the appropriate expert based on the user query.
- Integrate with Langchain for document loading, splitting, and retrieval.
- Utilize Chroma as the vector database for efficient storage and retrieval.
- Supports various configuration options through the `config.yaml` file.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- Langchain
- Sentence Transformers
- YAML
- Requests

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-repo/calling-coe-models.git
  ```

2. Install the required dependencies::
  ```bash
  - With pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt` 
  - With poetry: `poetry install --no-root`
  ```
2b. - Create venv 
  ```bash
  python<version> -m venv <virtual-environment-name>
  ```


3. Set up the config.yaml file with your API credentials and preferences. Example:
  ```yaml
  api: sambastudio

  llm:
   temperature: 0.1
   max_tokens_to_generate: 1024
   sambaverse_model_name: "Mistral/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2"
   samabaverse_select_expert: "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2"
   coe_routing: true

   retrieval:
   chunk_size: 1000
   chunk_overlap: 200
   db_type: "faiss"
  ```

4. Create a .env file in the project root directory and provide the necessary API keys based on your chosen entry point:
  ```env
# NEEDED FOR SAMBAVERSE
SAMBAVERSE_API_KEY="133-adb-you-key-here"
SAMBAVERSE_URL="https://yoururl"

# NEEDED FOR SAMBASTUDIO COE MODEL
BASE_URL="https://yoursambstudio.url"
PROJECT_ID="your-samba-studio_coe_model-projectid"
ENDPOINT_ID="your-samba-studio-coe_model-endpointid"
API_KEY="your-samba-studio-coe_model-apikey"
VECTOR_DB_URL=http://localhost:6333

# NEEDED FOR SAMBASTUDIO EMBEDDINGS MODEL
EMBED_BASE_URL="https://yoursambstudio.url"
EMBED_PROJECT_ID="your-samba-studio_embedding_model-projectid"
EMBED_ENDPOINT_ID="your-samba-studio-embedding_model-endpointid"
EMBED_API_KEY="your-samba-studio-embedding_model-apikey"
  ```

The script supports both SambaVerse and SambaStudio APIs. Depending on which API you want to use, provide the corresponding API keys and URLs in the .env file. If you choose to use the SNSDK instead of requests, make sure you have it installed and configured with your credentials.

### Usage

#### Calling CoE Models with the Python Script

1\. Update the `config.yaml` file with your desired configuration\.

2\. Run the `use_coe_model.py` script\:

  ```bash
  python use_coe_model.py
  ``` 



The script will load documents, create a vector database, set up the language model based on the configuration, and invoke the retrieval chain with a user query.

Using the Jupyter Notebook
1. Open the calling\_coe\_models\.ipynb notebook in Jupyter.

2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run each example:

- Example 1: Using SambaVerse to call CoE Model
- Example 2: Using SambaStudio to call CoE with Named Expert
- Example 3: Using SambaStudio to call CoE with Routing

3. Update the config\.yaml file as needed for each example.

4. Run the notebook cells to execute the code and observe the results.
