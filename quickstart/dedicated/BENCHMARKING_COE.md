# Benchmarking a model bundle or Composition of Experts (CoE)

The [SambaNova Composition of Experts (CoE)](https://sambanova.ai/technology/composition-of-experts) model architecture combines the broad capabilities and accuracy of the worldâ€™s largest models with the performance of much smaller models, model ownership, and the ability to apply role based access controls. The CoE is a system of multiple experts, where each expert is a fully trained machine learning model.

A CoE model is an ensemble of many models that work in conjunction with each other. There can be any number of models in the ensemble to meet the needs of any organization. The composition can consist of any combination of base, pre-trained, and fine-tuned models.

CoE offers a single API endpoint that enables the orchestration of these domain-specific experts across various fields such as finance, legal, and engineering. CoE combines the strengths of large, monolithic models with the advantages of smaller, specialized models, resulting in a more balanced and efficient approach that mitigates the limitations of each.

## Required steps

The required steps for CoE benchmarking are the following:

- Create a CoE model bundle (if not already created). Cf. (<./Create a Model Bundle.ipynb>).
- Create a project and an endpoint (if not already created). Cf. <./Deploy a Model or Bundle to an Endpoint.ipynb>.
- Deploy the CoE model bundle to the endpoint (if not already deployed). <./Deploy a Model or Bundle to an Endpoint.ipynb>
- Run the benchmarking script. Cf. (<./Benchmark_Model_Bundle.ipynb>).

## Setup

The next step is to set up your environment variables to use one of the models available from SambaNova. If you're a current SambaNova customer, you can deploy your models with SambaStudio. If you are not a SambaNova customer, you can self-service provision API endpoints using SambaNova Cloud.

- If using **SambaNova Cloud** Please follow the instructions [here](../README.md#use-sambanova-cloud-option-1) for setting up your environment variables.

- If using **SambaStudio** Please follow the instructions [here](../README.md#use-sambastudio-option-2) for setting up endpoint and your environment variables. 

_Note: In case of OpenAI compatible SambaNova endpoints, dynamic batching is already supported. However, in case you're using a **SambaStudio Turbo** endpoint, please update the URL variable and include `api/v2` like the following to ensure the use of dynamic batching:_

``` bash
SAMBASTUDIO_URL="https://api-stage.sambanova.net/api/v2/predict/generic/12345678-9abc-def0-1234-56789abcdef0/456789ab-cdef-0123-4567-89abcdef0123"
```

1. (Recommended) Create a virtual environment and activate it (python version 3.11 recommended): 

    ```bash
    python<version> -m venv <virtual-environment-name>
    source <virtual-environment-name>/bin/activate
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd benchmarking # If not already in the benchmarking folder
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

1.  Install the following libraries using the wheels provided to you by your SambaNova representative:  

    - `pip install ~/Downloads/snsdk-<version>-py3-none-any.whl`  
    - `pip install ~/Downloads/SambaStudio_API_Client-<version>-py3-none-any.whl`

3.  Set the following environment variables in your `.env` file as provided by your SambaNova representative:

    - For the creation of model bundles and the and deployment of endpoints.
    ```.env
    SAMBASTUDIO_HOST_NAME = '<host name without any trailing "/">'
    SAMBASTUDIO_ACCESS_KEY = '<access key>'
    SAMBASTUDIO_TENANT_NAME = '<tenant name if provided, else "default">'
    ```

    - For the benchmarking script.
    ```.env
    SAMBASTUDIO_URL='<your endpoint url>'
    SAMBASTUDIO_API_KEY='<your endpoint API KEY>'
    ```

## Strategy to select the models in a bundle

## Bounds for CoE creation

__Memory__. The first bound for CoE creation is the size of the Double Data Rate (DDR) memory used by the composition. Each added expert will use a portion of this memory during configuration. If the total number of experts exceeds this limit, the CoE creation will fail in order to prevent memory overflow.
You will be notified with a warning message that explains the issue. You will need to change your combination of selected experts to add by choosing different experts (a lower number of experts or experts of a smaller size) in order to proceed and stay within the DDR usage limit.

__Model Compatibility__. Conflicts can occur when selecting a new expert that is technically incompatible with the experts already chosen. This incompatibility could be due to technical restrictions that exist among experts. The system is designed to detect such conflicts during expert selection. When a conflict is identified, the system will alert you with an error message and will block the selection to avoid potential issues. You will need to modify your selected experts to add by choosing different experts in order to proceed.

__RDU Compatibility__. You will only be able to add expert models to your Composition of Experts that are compatible with your selection of SN40L-8 or SN40L-16 RDUs.
The SN40L-16 RDU architecture will provide faster CoE creation times.

## Benchmarking script

Modify the following files:
- _PATH TO AISK REPO HERE/benchmarking/benchmarking_scripts/config.yaml_

    With the desired input and output paths.

    ```yaml
    model_configs_path: '<PATH TO AISK REPO HERE>/benchmarking/benchmarking_scripts/model_configs_example.csv'
    llm_api: 'sambastudio'  # or sncloud for the cloud
    output_files_dir: '<PATH TO AISK REPO HERE>/benchmarking/data/benchmarking_tracking_tests/logs/output_files'
    consolidated_results_dir: '<PATH TO AISK REPO HERE>/benchmarking/data/benchmarking_tracking_tests/consolidated_results'
    timeout: 3600
    time_delay: 0
    ```

- _PATH TO AISK REPO HERE/benchmarking/benchmarking_scripts/model_configs_example.csv_

    With the desired model configurations to test.

    ```csv
    model_name,input_tokens,output_tokens,num_requests,concurrent_requests,qps,qps_distribution,multimodal_img_size
    ```

## Configuration parameters

The configuration table in `model_configs_example.csv` details each individual model of the composition that we would like to test, together with other parameters.

-  `model_name`. The name of the model in the bundle.
-  `input_tokens`. Number of input tokens: The number of input tokens in the generated prompt. Default: 1000.
-  `output_tokens`. Number of output tokens: The number of output tokens the LLM can generate. Default: 1000.
-  `num_requests`. Number of total requests: Number of requests sent. Default: 10. Note: the program can timeout before all requests are sent.
    Configure the Timeout parameter in your `benchmarking_scripts/config.yaml` accordingly.
    The Timeout is the Number of seconds before program times out. Default: 600 seconds
    Statistics (min, max, and mediam) will be calculated over this number of requests.
- `concurrent_requests`. Number of concurrent requests: The number of concurrent requests. Default: 1.
    For testing batching-enabled models, this value should be greater than the largest batch_size one needs to test. The typical batch sizes that are supported are 1, 4, 8, and 16.
- `qps`. Queries per second: the number of queries that will be sent to the endpoint per second.
    Values QPS<10 are recommended since user can hit rate limits. Default: 1.0
- `qps_distribution`. Queries per second distribution: the type of wait time distribution in between requests.
    User can choose the values 'constant', 'uniform', 'exponential'. Default: constant.
- `multimodal_img_size`. If the model selected is multimodal, then select the pre-set image size to include in the benchmarking requests.
    There are three categories: Small (500x500px), Medium (1000x1000px) and Large (2000x2000px).
    Otherwise, if model is not multimodal, then leave the value to N/A.

Notice that the sum of `input_tokens` and `output_tokens` should not exceed the sequence length of the model that we want to test.
E.g. if we want to test how a model performs with a sequence lenght of 4096 tokens, we can set `input_tokens` to 4000 and `output_tokens` to 64, so that their sum does not exceed 4096.

## Results

### Individual results
Individual results will be stored in the `output_files_dir` defined in your `benchmarking_scripts/config.yaml`.

For every model configuration defined in each row of your `model_configs_example.csv` table, two results will be stored.

1. Individual responses files end will `individual_responses.json`.
    It contains performance metrics for every request.
    E.g. if _num_requests_ is set to 10, you will have 10 entries.

2. Summary files end will `summary.json`.
    It contains statistics calculated from the individual responses file, such as the min, the max, several quantiles, and the standard deviation.

### Consolidated results

Consolidated results will be stored in the `consolidated_results_dir` defined in your `benchmarking_scripts/config.yaml`.

Every row of the `model_configs_example.csv` will have its corresponding row in the consolidated results table, i.e. `consolidated_results_<date>.xlsx`.

N.B.
- Server metrics: These are performance metrics from the Server API.
    A prefix `server` will be added to the metric name.
- Client metrics: These are performance metrics computed on the client side / local machine.
    A prefix `client` will be added to the metric name.
- The suffixes `min`, `max`, and `p_50` represent the minimum, maximum, and the median respectively.
- The suffix `s` indicates that the value is in seconds.
- The prefix `mean` refers to the mean value.

The main columns of consolidated results are the following:
- `ttft_s`. Time to First Token (TTFT).
    One should see higher values and higher variance in the client-side metrics compared to the server-side metrics. This difference is mainly due to the request waiting in the queue to be served (for concurrent requests), which is not included in server-side metrics.
- `server_end_to_end_latency`. End-to-end latency.
    One should see higher values and higher variance in the client-side metrics compared to the server-side metrics. This difference is also mainly due to the request waiting in the queue to be served (for concurrent requests), which is not included in server-side metrics.
- `server_output_token_per_s`. Output throughput, i.e. the number of output tokens per second per request.
    One should see good agreement between the client and server-side metrics. For endpoints that support dynamic batching, one should see a decreasing trend in metrics as the batch size increases.
- `acceptance_rate`. Acceptance rate for speculative decoding pairs.


### Switching time
The switching time indicates the time required to switch from one model to another in a CoE bundle.
A switch is triggered not only by a different model name, but also a different sequence length and a different batch size.
The latest technology of RDUs, SN40L, also offers High-speed HBM memory bandwidth to significantly speed up inference workloads.
Each time that a new model configuration is called for inference, it needs to be loaded into the HBM memory.
The switching time can be zero if the HBM memory is not saturated (e.g. smaller model configurations, with fewer number of parameters, or smaller sequence lengths, or smaller batch sizes are involved in the switch).
On the other hand, if the HBM memory is saturated, the memory loading operation leads to a non zero switching time.

You can extract the switching time of a request from the `switching_time` key in its corresponding entry in the `individual_responses.json` file.

In order to estimate the switching time of a model in a CoE bundle of `N` models, it is important to rotate the order in witch the models will be called in your `model_configs_example.csv` configuration file.
For example, if your bundle has 3 models configurations that would trigger a switch, you could run the benchmarking scripts several times, in order to get a better idea on how the order of the rows can influence the switching time.

The switching time is estimated as follows.
Based on the first request TTFT in `individual_responses.json`, if this value is significantly larger (more than 3 standard deviations) than the average TTFT of the remaining requests, then switching time will be the difference between first TTFT and the average of the remaining TTFTs.
