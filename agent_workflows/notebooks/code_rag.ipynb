    "Users can at times expect an AI application to understand their queries, even if they are vague and contain embedded semantic logic, such as a short form query that is actually compound in nature.  There is no explicit breakdown of all subqueries, because domain experts generally understand what is meant by the short form query.  In production, this is a challenging task for an AI model to handle, as foundation models are generally trained on internet scale information, which is not gauranteed to contain domain specific logic.  In fact, this kind of logic could even be harmful for generalization, as the langugage would not make much sense with respect to other contexts.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Queries, even if clear, may be compound in nature and may require subquery decomposition for targeted QA using paradigms/techniques such as RAG.  This in turn may also necessitate the need for: reranking, vectorstore filtering for initial entity-aware document retrieval to remove/prevent noise, aggregation, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, compound queries may be comparitive in nature and may require mathematical operations, which may require the use of a code generation model to generate the code for the mathematical operations.  Alternatively, agents with tools/libraries that can handle such operations can be used, which will add more determinism, and hopefully reliability.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the longer and more complex the agentic pipeline, the more the possibilities for cumulative errors to come up, and so development and maintenance may become difficult to scale across edge cases.  If this is the case, it may be preferable to move to a dynamic, human in the loop type of system. That route has its own unique challenges, such as robust routing and team setups.  A simple example can be found here: [Corrective RAG team](./../../agent_workflows/notebooks/corrective_rag_team.ipynb)."

    "## Description of pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "This complicated pipeline should demonstrate how seemingly straight forward user queries can require more and more complexity, which in turn means more optimization of agent system prompts, implementations for edge cases, etc.  It is recommended to start developing RAG systems for simple cases along with users and scale up complexity when really needed for user experience.  At some point, there will need to be a tradeoff between user experience/ease of use, latency (long chains will incur more and more calls to LLMs), and development challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "After initializing some counters to keep track of coding attempts, etc. The user query encounters the first conditional edge, which is an agent judge that determines, based on the [example router](./../../prompt_engineering/prompts/llama3_8b-prompt_engineering-example_judge.yaml) prompt, if the query needs reformulation or not.  If reformulation is needed, the judge determines the response to be \"example selection\".  Example selection routes to the reformulate query node. This node calls the reformulate_query method from the RAGComponents class.  This method calls the get_example_selector method to create a retriever for the examples.  After the retriever is instantiated, the get_examples method is called to obtain examples, based on the similarity of the example queries and the user query.  Each example contains a key value pair, which is the expected user query to be reformulated and the reformulated query.  A reformulation chain with the system prompt: [query reformulation](./../../prompt_engineering/prompts/llama3_8b-prompt_engineering-query_reformulation.yaml).  If no reformulation is needed, then the query simply passes to the next node, get_new_query, which is essentially just a pass through node that exists so we can connect a conditional edge to it (conditional edges need to be connected to nodes, not other edges).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The next conditional edge is another agent judge.  This agent determines if the query is compound in nature and requires query decomposition, via its system prompt [subquery router](./../../prompt_engineering/prompts/llama3_8b-prompt_engineering-subquery_router.yaml).  If subquery generation is required, the query is then routed to the generate subquestions node.  This node calls the generate_subquestion method from RAGComponents, which obtains the question from the current state and passes it to the subquery_chain, which uses the prompt [subquery generation](./../../prompt_engineering/prompts/llama3_8b-prompt_engineering-subquery_generation.yaml).  Subquestions are converted to a list by splitting on new lines and then returned to subquestions in the state as an update.  If no subqueries are required, the query is simply passed along again.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Either the question or list of subquestions are then passed to a loop, which would be flattened with the use of batch online inference, if latency requirements demand it.  This loop consists of: entity detection, retrieval with metadata filtering, document grading for relevancy, RAG generation, hallucination detection, and answer relevancy determination.  All of these steps ensure that high quality data is received and help to filter out noise when retrieving docuemtns/contexts and that answers are checked to be faithful to the source materials and helpful.  The entity detection is performed via a chain using the [entity determination](./../../prompt_engineering/prompts/llama3_8b-prompt_engineering-entity_determination.yaml) prompt and some logic that handles queries versus subqueries.  Entities are then used at the next node, retrieve, which calls the retrieve_w_filtering of RAGComponents to first filter the vectorstore by the entity name using metadata (simplified as filename, as the front ends typically involve creating vectorstores from files).  If reranking is chosen in the configs (and is recommended if not using a fine tuned embedding model), then reranking will be performed on the documents and they will be resorted.  The initial top k_retrieved_documents is the initial amount of documents to retrieve and rerank, and the final_k_retrieved_documents is the amount of documents to keep and hand to the rest of the chain.  Sequence length of the model is the main factor controlling the final k, as document grading should filter out irrelevant documents.  After documents have been obtained and passed into the graph state, they are then graded for relevancy, which is done by the grade_documents method of RAGComponents.  The grading is done by comparing the query with the document and using the retrieval_grader chain with the [retrieval grading](./../../prompt_engineering/prompts/llama3_8b-prompt_engineering-retrieval_grading.yaml) prompt.  A binary score \"yes\" or \"no\" is returned.  If the score is \"yes\", the document is considered relevant, if \"no\", it is not.  The grading is then used to filter out irrelevant documents.  Only relevant documents are then passed to the next node, RAG generation.  With the final set of documents, RAG generation is performed at the generate node, which calls the rag_generate method from the RAGComponents class.  This method formats the list of documents into a string separated by new lines and passes the formated documents to the qa_chain.  This chain takes the question (or subquestion) and the formatted documents and is instructed by the [qa](./../../prompt_engineering/prompts/llama3_8b-prompt_engineering-qa.yaml) prompt.  The current generation is updated in the state and appended to the answer list of the state.  A conditional edge is then called to check the generation for both hallucinations (the response should be grounded in the documents) and answer relevancy (the generation should actually answer the question/subquestion).  Hallucinations are checked first.  Documents are formatted, as they were in the generation step, and then passed to the hallucination chain.  The hallucination chain uses the [hallucination detection](./../../prompt_engineering/prompts/llama3_8b-prompt_engineering-hallucination_detection.yaml) prompt to provide the binary score \"yes\" or \"no\".  If scored \"no\", then the generation will be routed to the failure message node.  If \"yes\", the generation is then checked by the grading chain, which takes the question/subquestion and generation and assess relevancy based on the [retrieval grading](./../../prompt_engineering/prompts/llama3_8b-prompt_engineering-retrieval_grading.yaml) prompt.  The grade is also a binary \"yes\" or \"no\".  If \"no\", then the generation is also passed to the failure message.  If \"yes\", then the answer/generation is kept as is and the loop continues with the answer(s) appended in the state.  If the answer is deemed as not useful or if it contains hallucinations, the question is passed to the failure_chain that uses the [failure message](./../../prompt_engineering/prompts/llama3_8b-prompt_engineering-code_exec_failure.yaml) prompt to massage the message for the user, which includes providing some suggestions for finding information besides consulting the vectorstore.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the question and/or all subquestions have been answered, there needs to be a determination if simple answer aggregation and summarization is required or if mathematical reasoning is needed to properly answer the question. The pass_to_codegen node collects the original question and sets it again as the question.  This is just done for simple booking keeping purposes.  A conditional edge using the route_question_to_code method from the CodeGenComponents class, is connected to this node.  At this step, the question (the original question now) is passed to the code_router chain with the [code router](./../../prompt_engineering/prompts/llama3_8b-prompt_engineering-code_router.yaml) prompt.  This chain will output either \"llm\" or \"codegen\", depending on the nature of the question.  If \"llm\" is determined, the aggregate answers node will call the aggregate_answers method in RAGComponents.  This method will convert the list of answers to a string seperated by two new lines so they are still somewhat individual and the question (original question) and string formatted list of answers will be passed to the aggregation_chain, which is instructed by the [answer aggregation](../../prompt_engineering/prompts/llama3_8b-prompt_engineering-answer_aggregation.yaml) prompt to answer the question as best and as fully as possible, while also allowing for partial answering over nothing.  If \"codegen\" is determined, the question and list of answers (formatted as a string) will be passed to the code_generation node.  The node will call the code_generation method from the CodeGenComponents class.  This method takes the questions and formatted list of answers and determines variables from those answers and tries to write code with those varables and the question.  After the code has been written, the parsed Python code snippet is passed to the determine_runnable_code node, which calls both Python REPL and the codegen_qc chain.  *It should be noted that Python REPL can execute arbitrary code on the host machine (e.g., delete files, make network requests). Use with caution.  For more information general security guidelines please see https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/security/.* - From Langchain documentation @ [Python REPL tool](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/tools/python/).  If the code can run without an exception it is set as the result.  If an exception occurs, it is caught and set as the result.  Once result is populated, there is some cleanup to prevent chain related exceptions (unfriendly string characters) and it is fed into the codegen_qc chain with instructions from: [codegen_qc](./../../prompt_engineering/prompts/llama3_8b-prompt_engineering-codegen_qc.yaml).  The output of this chain is either \"runnable\" or \"exception\" and is fed to the is_runnable state.  At this point there is a conditional edge that calls decide_to_refactor from the CodeGenComponents class.  This method assesses the is_runnable output from the state and returns \"executed\", \"exception\", or \"unsuccessful\".  Both \"executed\" and \"exception\" are directly read from the state's last step.  However, \"unsuccessful\" is determined if the code_counter state variable (which is updated later) reaches the user's set limit via the configuration.  If there is an exception, the code and the exception message will be passed to the refactor_code node and method of the same name in CodeGen Components.  The code_counter will be updated by 1 and the refactor chain using the [code refactor](./../../prompt_engineering/prompts/llama3_8b-prompt_engineering-code_refactor.yaml) prompt will be invoked.  This will attempt to refactor the code, based on the model's codegen capabilities.  What follows is generally similar to the code_generation node.  Python REPL is used to try to run the refactored code.  If the code can run without an exception, the refactor_code method returns the state with updated: code, the resultant generation, and the updated code_counter.  If an exception occurs, the state is returned with updated: code, the error, and an updated code_counter.  The state is then fed back into the determine_runnable_code node to iteratively retry in a loop until either the code has been executed or the code_counter reaches the maximum number of attempts specified in the application configuration by the user.  If the code_counter exceeds the maximum number of attempts, there is routing to the code_error_msg node and method.  The final code and error/exception is then simply passed into a deterministic overall error message.  This message is appended to the answers list.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize everything that has been done and to answer the original question, the original question and final generation are passed to the final_chain with the [final chain](./../../prompt_engineering/prompts/llama3_8b-prompt_engineering-final_chain.yaml) prompt.  This massages the information into one, final answer.  If the question could not be answered, it provides some suggestionso n how a user may be able to find more information.  \n",

    "### Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "This example should provide insight, through working examples, of how seemingly simple user expectations can balloon into very complicated implementations. Latency, cumulative error, and prompt optimization should all be considered.  It is recommended to build from simple queries to queries with a higher level of complexity and functionality demand as a project or application progresses to keep a healthy check on scaling needs for the application and to know when enough has been implemented.  In many cases, it may be that a hierarchical approach with human in the loop guidance is a better end experience than a very long and involved pipeline, even if latency is reduced via custom hardware, such as SambaNova Systems RDUs due to the other challenges mentioned.

Management applies judgment in determining whether the Company is the principal or agent in transactions with Drivers, Merchants and end-users. This determination impacts the presentation of revenue on a gross or net basis as well as the presentation of incentives provided to Drivers and Merchants and discounts and promotions offered to end-users, to the extent they are not customers. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company’s Mobility and Delivery revenue, net of incentives, was $15.3 billion and discounts, loyalty programs, promotions, refunds, and credits provided to end-users who are not customers totaled $2.4 billion, of which a significant portion relates to discounts and promotions.\n",

Management applies judgment in determining whether the Company is the principal or agent in transactions with Drivers, Merchants and end-users. This determination impacts the presentation of revenue on a gross or net basis as well as the presentation of incentives provided to Drivers and Merchants and discounts and promotions offered to end-users, to the extent they are not customers. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company’s Mobility and Delivery revenue, net of incentives, was $15.3 billion and discounts, loyalty programs, promotions, refunds, and credits provided to end-users who are not customers totaled $2.4 billion, of which a significant portion relates to discounts and promotions.\n",

      "Uber Technologies, Inc. (“Uber,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) was incorporated in Delaware in July 2010, and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. Uber is a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B. Uber develops and operates proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on its platform (“platform(s)” or “Platform(s)”).

Pursuant to this change, drivers who use Uber’s platform in the UK will earn at least the National Living Wage for time spent actively working, be paid holiday pay, and will be enrolled into a pension plan if eligible. We have also announced a partnership with labor union GMB to provide an even stronger voice to drivers and to raise the standard of flexible work across the industry.\n",

      "Progression: We have partnered with Arizona State University to offer eligible Drivers and their family members access to over 100 undergraduate degree programs, courses in English language learning, or a certificate in entrepreneurship.

Pursuant to this change, drivers who use Uber’s platform in the UK will earn at least the National Living Wage for time spent actively working, be paid holiday pay, and will be enrolled into a pension plan if eligible. We have also announced a partnership with labor union GMB to provide an even stronger voice to drivers and to raise the standard of flexible work across the industry.\n",

      "of our efforts to generate revenue are new and unproven, and any failure to adequately increase revenue or contain the related costs could prevent us from attaining or increasing profitability. In addition, we sometimes introduce new products that we expect to add value to our overall platform and network but which we expect will generate lower Gross Bookings per Trip or a lower Take Rate. Further, we charge a lower service fee to certain of our largest chain restaurant partners on our Delivery offering to grow the number of Delivery consumers, which may at times result in a negative take rate with respect to those transactions after considering amounts collected from consumers and paid to Drivers. As we expand our offerings to additional cities, our offerings in these cities may be less profitable than the markets in which we currently operate. As such, we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the near term, in accordance with our expectations, or at all. Additionally, we may not realize the operating efficiencies we expect to achieve as a result of our acquisition of Careem and Postmates, and may continue to incur significant operating losses in\n",

      "Our growth strategy has included the restructuring of our business and assets by divesting our business and assets in certain jurisdictions and partnering with and investing in local ridesharing, and delivery companies to participate in those markets rather than operate in those markets independently. Our growth strategy has also included the divestment of certain lines of businesses in its entirety, and not just in certain jurisdictions, and instead partnering and investing in our competitors in those lines of businesses. As a result, a significant portion of our assets includes minority ownership positions, including in Didi, Grab, our Yandex.Taxi joint venture, Lime, Zomato and Aurora.\n",

      "\n",
      "To continue to retain and attract Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers to our platform, we will need to continue to invest in the development of new products, offerings, and features that add value for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers and that differentiate us from our competitors. For example, in January 2020, we introduced a number of product changes in California intended to, among other things, provide Drivers with more information about rider destinations, trip distance, and expected fares, display prices more clearly, and allow users to select preferred Drivers, all of which are intended to further strengthen the independence of Drivers in California and protect their ability to work flexibly when using the Uber platform.\n",
      "Our failure to upgrade our technology or network infrastructure effectively to support our growth could result in unanticipated system disruptions, slow response times, or poor experiences for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers. To manage the growth of our operations and personnel and improve the technology that supports our business operations, as well as our financial and management systems, disclosure controls and procedures, and internal controls over financial reporting, we will be required to commit substantial financial, operational, and technical resources. In particular, we will need to improve our transaction processing and reporting, operational, and financial systems, procedures, and controls. For example, due to our significant growth, especially with respect to our high-growth emerging offerings like Delivery and Freight, we face challenges in timely and appropriately designing controls in response to evolving risks of material misstatement. These improvements are and will be particularly challenging when we acquire new businesses with different systems. Our current and planned personnel, systems, procedures, and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations. If we are unable to expand our operations and hire additional qualified personnel in an efficient manner, or if our operational technology is insufficient to reliably service Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, or carriers, platform user satisfaction will be adversely\n",
      "The markets in which we compete have attracted significant investments from a wide range of funding sources, and we anticipate that many of our competitors will continue to be highly capitalized. Moreover, certain of our stockholders, including SoftBank (a large stockholder), have made substantial investments in certain of our competitors and may increase such investments, make new investments in other competitors, or enter into strategic transactions with competitors in the future. These investments or strategic transactions, along with other competitive advantages discussed above, may allow our competitors to compete more effectively against us and continue to lower their prices, offer Driver incentives or consumer discounts and promotions, or otherwise attract Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers to their platform and away from ours. Such competitive pressures may lead us to maintain or lower fares or service fees or maintain or increase our Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions. Ridesharing and certain other categories in which we compete are relatively nascent, and we cannot guarantee that they will stabilize at a competitive equilibrium that will allow us to achieve profitability.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have incurred significant losses since inception, including in the United States and other major markets. We expect our operating expenses to increase significantly in the foreseeable future, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability.\n",
      "Delivery\n",
      "\n",
      "We typically expect to experience seasonal increases in our revenue in the first and fourth quarters compared to the second and third quarters, although the historical growth of Delivery has masked these seasonal fluctuations. In 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which accelerated the growth of Delivery in 2021 as cities impose various dining restrictions.\n",

      "Employees\n",

      "We are a global company and as of December 31, 2021, we and our subsidiaries had approximately 29,300 employees globally and operations in approximately 72 countries and approximately 10,500 cities around the world. Our human capital strategies are developed and managed by our Chief People Officer, who reports to the CEO, and are overseen by the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors.\n",

      "Our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain high-quality management, operations, engineering, and other personnel who are in high\n",
      "\n",
      "demand, are often subject to competing employment offers, and are attractive recruiting targets for our competitors.\n",
      "Further, while we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused on a limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted manner than we do. As we and our competitors introduce new products and offerings, and as existing products evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition. In addition, our competitors may adopt certain of our product features, or may adopt innovations that Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers value more highly than ours, which would render our products less attractive or reduce our ability to differentiate our products. Increased competition could result in, among other things, a reduction of the revenue we generate from the use of our platform, the number of platform users, the frequency of use of our platform, and our margins.\n",
      "\n",
      "We face competition in each of our offerings, including:\n",
      "Our organizational structure is complex and will continue to grow as we add additional Drivers, consumers, merchants, carriers, shippers, employees, products and offerings, and technologies, and as we continue to expand globally. We will need to improve our operational, financial, and management controls as well as our reporting systems and procedures to support the growth of our organizational structure. We will require capital and management resources to grow and mature in these areas. If we are unable to effectively manage the growth of our business, the quality of our platform may suffer, and we may be unable to address competitive challenges, which would adversely affect our overall business, operations, and financial condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "19\n",
      "\n",
      "If platform users engage in, or are subject to, criminal, violent, inappropriate, or dangerous activity that results in major safety incidents, our ability to attract and retain Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers may be harmed, which could have an adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition, and operating results.\n",
      "To remain competitive in certain markets and generate network scale and liquidity, we have in the past lowered, and may continue to lower, fares or service fees, and we have offered and may continue to offer significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions. At times, in certain geographic markets, we have offered, and may continue to offer, Driver incentives that cause the total amount of the fare that a Driver retains, combined with the Driver incentives a Driver receives from us, to increase, at times meeting or exceeding the amount of Gross Bookings we generate for a given Trip. In certain geographic markets and regions, we do not have a leading category position, which may result in us choosing to further increase the amount of Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions that we offer in those geographic markets and regions. We cannot assure you that offering such Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions will be successful. Driver incentives, consumer discounts, promotions, and reductions in fares and our service fee have negatively affected, and will continue to negatively affect, our financial performance. Additionally, we rely on pricing models to calculate consumer fares and Driver earnings, which have been modified over time and will likely in the future be modified, and pricing models at times vary based upon jurisdiction.

      "Our growth strategy has included the restructuring of our business and assets by divesting our business and assets in certain jurisdictions and partnering with and investing in local ridesharing, and delivery companies to participate in those markets rather than operate in those markets independently. Our growth strategy has also included the divestment of certain lines of businesses in its entirety, and not just in certain jurisdictions, and instead partnering and investing in our competitors in those lines of businesses. As a result, a significant portion of our assets includes minority ownership positions, including in Didi, Grab, our Yandex.Taxi joint venture, Lime, Zomato and Aurora.\n",

For example, in January 2020, we introduced a number of product changes in California intended to, among other things, provide Drivers with more information about rider destinations, trip distance, and expected fares, display prices more clearly, and allow users to select preferred Drivers, all of which are intended to further strengthen the independence of Drivers in California and protect their ability to work flexibly when using the Uber platform.\n",

From time to time, we have made pricing changes and spent significant amounts on marketing and both rider and driver incentives, and we expect that, from time to time, we will be required, through competition, regulation or otherwise, to reduce the price of rides for riders, increase the incentives we pay to drivers on our platform or reduce the fees we charge the drivers on our platform, or to increase our marketing and other expenses to attract and retain qualified drivers and riders in response to competitive pressures.

      "of our efforts to generate revenue are new and unproven, and any failure to adequately increase revenue or contain the related costs could prevent us from attaining or increasing profitability. In addition, we sometimes introduce new products that we expect to add value to our overall platform and network but which we expect will generate lower Gross Bookings per Trip or a lower Take Rate. Further, we charge a lower service fee to certain of our largest chain restaurant partners on our Delivery offering to grow the number of Delivery consumers, which may at times result in a negative take rate with respect to those transactions after considering amounts collected from consumers and paid to Drivers. As we expand our offerings to additional cities, our offerings in these cities may be less profitable than the markets in which we currently operate. As such, we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the near term, in accordance with our expectations, or at all.

      "To continue to retain and attract Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers to our platform, we will need to continue to invest in the development of new products, offerings, and features that add value for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers and that differentiate us from our competitors. For example, in January 2020, we introduced a number of product changes in California intended to, among other things, provide Drivers with more information about rider destinations, trip distance, and expected fares, display prices more clearly, and allow users to select preferred Drivers, all of which are intended to further strengthen the independence of Drivers in California and protect their ability to work flexibly when using the Uber platform.\n",
      "Our growth strategy has included the restructuring of our business and assets by divesting our business and assets in certain jurisdictions and partnering with and investing in local ridesharing, and delivery companies to participate in those markets rather than operate in those markets independently. Our growth strategy has also included the divestment of certain lines of businesses in its entirety, and not just in certain jurisdictions, and instead partnering and investing in our competitors in those lines of businesses. As a result, a significant portion of our assets includes minority ownership positions, including in Didi, Grab, our Yandex.Taxi joint venture, Lime, Zomato and Aurora.\n",
      "Our failure to upgrade our technology or network infrastructure effectively to support our growth could result in unanticipated system disruptions, slow response times, or poor experiences for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers. To manage the growth of our operations and personnel and improve the technology that supports our business operations, as well as our financial and management systems, disclosure controls and procedures, and internal controls over financial reporting, we will be required to commit substantial financial, operational, and technical resources. In particular, we will need to improve our transaction processing and reporting, operational, and financial systems, procedures, and controls. For example, due to our significant growth, especially with respect to our high-growth emerging offerings like Delivery and Freight, we face challenges in timely and appropriately designing controls in response to evolving risks of material misstatement. These improvements are and will be particularly challenging when we acquire new businesses with different systems. Our current and planned personnel, systems, procedures, and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations. If we are unable to expand our operations and hire additional qualified personnel in an efficient manner, or if our operational technology is insufficient to reliably service Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, or carriers, platform user satisfaction will be adversely\n",

We encourage different opinions and approaches to be heard, and then we come together and build. We believe that when employees feel empowered to succeed in a work environment that celebrates, supports, and invests in diversity, progress follows. To achieve our objective to increase diversity in who we hire, we implement processes throughout Uber and measure progress. For example, the Mansfield Rule was implemented by June 2021, to ensure that we have considered women, LGBTQIA+ individuals, people with disabilities, and racially underrepresented talent by requiring that a certain percentage of candidates considered for leadership roles come from historically underrepresented groups.\n",

      "The markets in which we compete have attracted significant investments from a wide range of funding sources, and we anticipate that many of our competitors will continue to be highly capitalized. Moreover, certain of our stockholders, including SoftBank (a large stockholder), have made substantial investments in certain of our competitors and may increase such investments, make new investments in other competitors, or enter into strategic transactions with competitors in the future. These investments or strategic transactions, along with other competitive advantages discussed above, may allow our competitors to compete more effectively against us and continue to lower their prices, offer Driver incentives or consumer discounts and promotions, or otherwise attract Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers to their platform and away from ours. Such competitive pressures may lead us to maintain or lower fares or service fees or maintain or increase our Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions. Ridesharing and certain other categories in which we compete are relatively nascent, and we cannot guarantee that they will stabilize at a competitive equilibrium that will allow us to achieve profitability.\n",

In 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which accelerated the growth of Delivery in 2021 as cities impose various dining restrictions.\n",

Our human capital strategies are developed and managed by our Chief People Officer, who reports to the CEO, and are overseen by the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors.\n",

      "Further, while we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused on a limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted manner than we do. As we and our competitors introduce new products and offerings, and as existing products evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition. In addition, our competitors may adopt certain of our product features, or may adopt innovations that Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers value more highly than ours, which would render our products less attractive or reduce our ability to differentiate our products. Increased competition could result in, among other things, a reduction of the revenue we generate from the use of our platform, the number of platform users, the frequency of use of our platform, and our margins.\n",

      "We face competition in each of our offerings, including:\n",
      "Our organizational structure is complex and will continue to grow as we add additional Drivers, consumers, merchants, carriers, shippers, employees, products and offerings, and technologies, and as we continue to expand globally. We will need to improve our operational, financial, and management controls as well as our reporting systems and procedures to support the growth of our organizational structure. We will require capital and management resources to grow and mature in these areas. If we are unable to effectively manage the growth of our business, the quality of our platform may suffer, and we may be unable to address competitive challenges, which would adversely affect our overall business, operations, and financial condition.\n",

      "number of approximate tokens (n words *1.3):  846.3000000000001\n",
      "If our growth slows more significantly than we currently expect, we may not be able to achieve profitability, which would adversely affect our financial results and future prospects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our Gross Bookings and revenue growth rates (in particular with respect to our ridesharing products) have slowed in recent periods, and we expect that they will continue to slow in the future. We believe that our growth depends on a number of factors, including the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and our ability to:\n",
      "\n",
      "grow supply and demand on our platform;\n",
      "\n",
      "increase existing platform users’ activity on our platform;\n",
      "\n",
      "continue to introduce our platform to new markets;\n",
      "\n",
      "provide high-quality support to Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers;\n",
      "\n",
      "expand our business and increase our market share and category position;\n",
      "\n",
      "compete with the products and offerings of, and pricing and incentives offered by, our competitors;\n",
      "\n",
      "develop new products, offerings, and technologies;\n",
      "\n",
      "identify and acquire or invest in businesses, products, offerings, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our platform;\n",
      "\n",
      "penetrate suburban and rural areas and increase the number of rides taken on our platform outside metropolitan areas;\n",
      "\n",
      "reduce the costs of our Mobility offering to better compete with personal vehicle ownership and usage and other low-cost alternatives like public transportation, which in many cases can be faster or cheaper than any other form of transportation;\n",
      "\n",
      "If we are unable to successfully introduce new or upgraded products, offerings, or features for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, we may fail to retain and attract such users to our platform and our operating results would be adversely affected.\n",
      "\n",
      "To continue to retain and attract Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers to our platform, we will need to continue to invest in the development of new products, offerings, and features that add value for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers and that differentiate us from our competitors. For example, in January 2020, we introduced a number of product changes in California intended to, among other things, provide Drivers with more information about rider destinations, trip distance, and expected fares, display prices more clearly, and allow users to select preferred Drivers, all of which are intended to further strengthen the independence of Drivers in California and protect their ability to work flexibly when using the Uber platform.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our growth strategy has included the restructuring of our business and assets by divesting our business and assets in certain jurisdictions and partnering with and investing in local ridesharing, and delivery companies to participate in those markets rather than operate in those markets independently. Our growth strategy has also included the divestment of certain lines of businesses in its entirety, and not just in certain jurisdictions, and instead partnering and investing in our competitors in those lines of businesses. As a result, a significant portion of our assets includes minority ownership positions, including in Didi, Grab, our Yandex.Taxi joint venture, Lime, Zomato and Aurora.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our organizational structure is complex and will continue to grow as we add additional Drivers, consumers, merchants, carriers, shippers, employees, products and offerings, and technologies, and as we continue to expand globally. We will need to improve our operational, financial, and management controls as well as our reporting systems and procedures to support the growth of our organizational structure. We will require capital and management resources to grow and mature in these areas. If we are unable to effectively manage the growth of our business, the quality of our platform may suffer, and we may be unable to address competitive challenges, which would adversely affect our overall business, operations, and financial condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "19\n",
      "\n",
      "If platform users engage in, or are subject to, criminal, violent, inappropriate, or dangerous activity that results in major safety incidents, our ability to attract and retain Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers may be harmed, which could have an adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition, and operating results.\n"

    "Many questions have been answered, but some seem to be unanswered and/or partially answered.  It generally looks like the cause is challenges with retrieval, but these questions are also naive and made without deep understanding of these documents, so the information may not always be present.  The agentic pipeline, though, seems to have all the capabilities it needs to answer these kinds of questions if information can be retrieved, from subquery generation to codegen for arithmetic reasoning.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Could the trading price of uber stock be volatile?\n",
    "No explicit mention to stock volatility was found.  However, retrieved contexts contain fairly concrete information that suggests that the stock could be volatile, so the LLM was able to determine that the stock could be volatile.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What was the difference in revenue for Uber between 2020 and 2021?\n",
    "Information for the revenue for both years was retrieved.  The original question suggested that math was required, so information was routed to codegen.  The information from the answers list was able to be parsed for inputs for the basic code that the codegen module put together.  Since this was simple code, it was executed without any errors and so refactoring loops were required.  This output was then passed to the final message node to be reformatted/stylized.\n",

    "Information for the revenue for both years was retrieved (it was necessary to set a high initial and final k value), incurring latency so embedding model fine tuning should be considered.  The original question suggested that math was required, so information was routed to codegen.  The information from the answers list was able to be parsed for inputs for the basic code that the codegen module, so reliabble code was generated.  The simple code was executed successfully and the output was then routed to the the final message node. \n",

    "Information for the revenue for both years was retrieved, see the note above about latency and embedding model fine tuning.  Like the question above, the question required routing to codegen.  Codegen was successful with slightly more complex logic than above.  The code executed correctly and was the output was later massaged by the final message node.\n",

    "No sources could be found for this simple question.  RAG is still performed, because there is no routing, but by the time the system is routed to the code routing node, it understands that the original question requires math.  The original query is routed to the codegen node(s).  Since this is a very basic coding question, the LLM was able to create code that was executable.  The output was then passed to the final message node to be reformatted/stylized.\n",

    "The pipeline seems to be able to handle all forms of queries/question provided to it, at least in terms of capability.  However, the retrieval, particularly for tabular information, remains a challenge with the OOB embedding model.  There are multiple ways to improve accuracy here for latency reduction; the embedding model could be fine tuned to improve retrieval results.  If latency is acceptable for users, the reranking model can be used with a high initial and final k for documents to avoid the embedding model fine tuning effort."
