<!-- /TOC -->

This comprehensive starter kit guides users through fine-tuning embeddings from unstructured data, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and open-source embedding models to enhance NLP task performance. It supports a flexible workflow catering to different stages of the fine-tuning process, from data preparation to evaluation.


# Key features

- **Automated Query Generation**: Automatically generate synthetic query-answer pairs from unstructured text.
- **Embedding Model Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tune open-source embedding models with a synthetic dataset via the Sentence Transformers library.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Benchmark the fine-tuned embeddings with metrics to quantify improvements.


 
Some things to note:

 * This kit is fine-tuning models from Hugging Face using the name of the model and the model_id referred to later.
 * We hope to have embedding model fine-tuning capability in SambaStudio very soon which will allow you to fine-tune embeddings models on SambaNova RDUs.
 * In this kit the SambaNova LLM is used in the dataset creation process, namely in creating questions and answers from the chunks in order to finetune the model.
 * This kit allows the use of SambaStudio: 

# Before you begin


## Clone the repo and install dependencies

1. Clone the ai-starter-kit repo.
```
  git clone https://github.com/sambanova/ai-starter-kit.git
```
2. Install the dependencies:
   - With poetry: `poetry install --no-root`
   - With pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
Clone the start kit repo.

## Ensure your environment meets prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Required libraries: Sentence Transformers, Hugging Face Transformers

## Set up the account and config file 


## Set up the models and config file

### Set up the inference endpoint, configs and environment variables

The next step is to set up your environment to use one of the models available from SambaNova. If you're a current SambaNova customer, you can deploy your models with SambaStudio. If you are not a SambaNova customer, you can self-service provision API endpoints using SambaStudio.

- If using **SambaStudio** Please follow the instructions [here](../README.md#use-sambastudio-option-3) for setting up endpoint and your environment variables.
    Then in the [config file](./config.yaml) set the llm `api` variable to `"sambastudio"`, set the `CoE` and `select_expert` configs if using a CoE endpoint.

- If using **SambaNova Fast-API** Please follow the instructions [here](../README.md#use-sambanova-fast-api-option-1) for setting up your environment variables.
    Then in the [config file](./config.yaml) set the llm `api` variable to `"fastapi"` and set the `select_expert` config depending on the model you want to use.


# Using the model

After you've completed installation, you can use and evaluate it. 

## Prepare data and run the script

The standard workflow consists of data preparation and script execution. Follow these steps:

1. Place your data in a directory that you later specify when you run the script. The script defaults to PDFs but supports other file types.
2. Run the script with necessary parameters. For example:

   ```bash
   python scriptfine_tune_embed_model_name.py --input_data_directory ./your_data_directory --output_data_directory ./processed_data
   ```

### Additional arguments

The script supports the following arguments to customize the process:

- `--file_extension` for specifying file types.
- `--split_ratio` to adjust the train-validation dataset split.
- `--force_retrain` to force retraining even if a finetuned model exists.

Run `python fine_tune_embed_model.py --help` for a full list of arguments and their descriptions.

## Perform finetuning using pre-generated data

If you've previously generated synthetic data and wish to proceed directly to fine-tuning:

1. Run the script with the following arguments: 
* `--train_dataset_path` and `--val_dataset_path are the paths to your pre-generated datasets.
* Specify the model and output directory. 


For example:

   ```bash
   python fine_tune_embed_model.py --train_dataset_path ./processed_data/train_dataset.json --val_dataset_path ./processed_data/val_dataset.json --model_id "your_model_id" --model_output_path ./finetuned_model
   ```

## Evaluating a finetuned model

To evaluate an existing finetuned model without re-running the entire process, specify the model path and run evaluation only (`--evaluate_only` argument). Follow these steps: 

1. Use the `--model_output_path` argument to point to your finetuned model directory.
2. Ensure the dataset paths are specified if they are not in the default location. 
3. Specify `--evaluate_only`. 

For example:

   ```bash
   python fine_tune_embed_model.py --val_dataset_path ./processed_data/val_dataset.json --model_output_path ./finetuned_model --evaluate_only
   ```

## Using SambaNova systems (SNS) embeddings

The script supports integrating SNS (SambaNova systems) embeddings for enhancing the retrieval and understanding capabilities within LangChain workflows. Consider these points when using SNS embeddings: 

* **Configuration**: Ensure that you have the `export.env` file set up with your SNS credentials, including `EMBED_BASE_URL`, `EMBED_PROJECT_ID`, `EMBED_ENDPOINT_ID`, and `EMBED_API_KEY`.
* **Integration Example**: The script demonstrates how to use SNS embeddings for document and query encoding, followed by computing cosine similarity for a given query against a set of documents. Additionally, it integrates these embeddings into a LangChain retrieval workflow, showcasing an end-to-end example of query handling and document retrieval.

To run the SNS embeddings integration:

   ```bash
   python sns_embedding_script.py
   ```

The script executes the embedding process for documents and queries, computes similarities, and demonstrates a LangChain retrieval workflow using the predefined embeddings.
